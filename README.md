ECommerce Mobile Site Pilot

You will need to a php server to run this - I recommend XAmpp, (https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html). Once installed just copy all files to the htdocs folder & go to the URL. E.g http://localhost/shop/login.php

All pages as in my documentation are done, I don't think we need to add anymore. However in case you want to just copy template.php & use this as it contains the navigation bar & structure for all pages.

If any links go to a page that is not found this means that other groups are responsible for these pages & it is simply for our site to plugin to their pages & functions.
